# Open Source RF Pulse Design Demos

This repository contains a series of interactive demos on RF Pulse Design in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. They exist as a part of the lecture **"Open Source Pulse Design and Interactive Demonstraction"** from the ISMRM 2020 education **"Hands-On: Pulse Sequence & RF Pulse Design"**.

## Setup

The user has two options for running the demonstration Jupyter notebooks.

**1. Binder (recommended):** Binder is a service that provides ready-made software environments that can be opened and run in the browser. To run the demos in the browser, click on: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jonbmartin/open-source-pulse-design/master). The Jupyter Notebooks can the be opened and run simply by clicking on their filenames once the environment is built, with no local installs.

**2. Locally:** To run the demos locally, the repository should be downloaded and unzipped. The following requirements will need to be satisfied on your device:
  - Python >= 3.5
  - sigpy >= 0.1.17 (and all dependencies, installed alongside with pip/conda)
  - matplotlib (pip/conda)
  - jupyter notebook (pip/conda)
  
  Open the exercises in a notebook by navigating to the directory in which the repostory was installed and typing ``` jupyter notebook ``` into the terminal.
