    "For our third exercise, let's move on to  adiabatic pulse design. Adiabatic pulses are a special class of RF pulses that can excite, refocus, or invert magnetization vectors uniformly, even in the presence of a spatially nonuniform $B_1$ field. This makes them a good choice for tricky imaging problems; they can overcome issues such as inhomogeneity resulting from the use of a surface coil. A critical difference between these pulses and the pulses we have previously designed is that adiabatic pulses do *not* follow the typical proportionality relationship between flip angle and $B_1$ amplitude. Instead, the flip angle depends on modulation of both the amplitude and frequency of the pulse.\n",
